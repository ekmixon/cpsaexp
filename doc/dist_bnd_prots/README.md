# Distance-Bounding Protocols

This directory contains the sources used to perform a CPSA analysis of
a variety of distance-bounding protocols.  A *distance-bounding
protocol* is an exchange of messages between parties that include a
prover and a verifier.  The verifier wants to determine whether the
prover is physically nearby.

To perform the analysis, type `make` in a shell.  The script `table`
creates a table that lists the elapse time required to analyze each
protocol.
