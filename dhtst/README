STATUS

The protocols in the *.prot and *.lsp files all work correctly.  They
are present just to stop the cpsatst script from complaining.

Protocol staticdh.scm:

This example shows that in this case, the tree computed by CPSA3 is a
subtree of what is computed by CPSA4.  Unlike other examples, there
are many cases in which CPSA4 cohorts have more members than their
equivalents in CPSA3.

Protocol dhnsl_use.scm:

This example shows a case in which one cohort in CPSA4 has an extra
member, and that leads to an extra a dead tree.  The parent skeleton
is labeled 3, and the extra cohort member is skeleton 10.

Protocol station_newhope.scm:

This example shows the case in which the tree computed by CPSA4 is a
much, much smaller than the one computed by CPSA3.  Tree 6 is one of
several trees that differ.  Tree 6 in CPSA3 contains examples in which
there is a failure to generalize, such as skeleton 23 which should
generalize to became skeleton 7.  I think this is to be expected
because I don't think that variable separation is working for
exponents.  I am not sure why there are so many other shapes.
