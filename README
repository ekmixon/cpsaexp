CPSA: A Crptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer

This program has been built and tested using Haskell Platform.
It is available from <http://haskell.org> or from
an operating system specific source.

$ cabal install cpsa

INSTALLING FROM A TARBALL

QUICK START (Linux)

: To build and install CPSA type:
$ make
$ make install

: To analyze a protocol you have put in prob.scm type:
$ cpsa -o prob.txt prob.scm
$ cpsagraph -o prob.xhtml prob.txt
$ firefox -remote "openFile(`pwd`/prob.xhtml)"

: Documentation and samples are in the directory given by
$ cpsa -h

: To view the user guide:
$ firefox -remote "openFile($HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsauser.html)"
: where X.Y.Z is the CPSA version number.

QUICK START (Mac)

: To build and install CPSA type:
$ make
$ make install

: To analyze a protocol you have put in prob.scm type:
$ cpsa -o prob.txt prob.scm
$ cpsagraph -o prob.xhtml prob.txt
$ open prob.xhtml

: Documentation and samples are in the directory given by
$ cpsa -h

: To view the user guide:
$ open $HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsauser.html
: where X.Y.Z is the CPSA version number.

QUICK START (Windows)

With Cygwin or MinGW, the installation is similar to the Linux
install.  The software has been tested on a Windows system on which
neither MinGW or Cygwin has been installed.  Install Haskell Platform
and then run the "setup.bat" batch file with administrator privileges.

If you do not have administrator privileges, run:

C:\...> runghc Setup.hs configure --user --prefix="DIRECTORY"
C:\...> runghc Setup.hs build
C:\...> runghc Setup.hs install

and place DIRECTORY\bin on your path.

Documentation and samples are in the directory given by
C:\...> cpsa -h

The installed programs can be run from the command prompt or via a
batch file.  Alternatively, copy doc/Make.hs into the directory
containing your CPSA problem statements, and load it into a Haskell
interpreter.  Read the source for usage instructions.

MAKEFILE

The file $HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsa.mk contains useful GNU Make
rules for inclusion, where X.Y.Z is CPSA version number.

Alternatively, copy the file Make.hs in the same directory into the
directory containing your CPSA problem statements.  The source file
has usage instructions.

PARALLELISM

CPSA is built so it can make use of multiple processors.  To make use
of more than one processor, start CPSA with a runtime flag that
specifies the number of processors to be used, such as "+RTS -N4
-RTS".  The GHC documentation describes the -N option in detail.

DOCUMENTATION

The starting point for CPSA documentation doc/index.html.  Most users
should read it and skip the rest of this section.

To build the documentation, the file supp-pdf.tex must be installed.
It is part of the TexLive texmf ConTeXt package.  On Linux, the name
of the package is context or texlive-context.  The design document and
the specification document require the xy-pic package, which is
included in texlive-pictures.

The documentation includes a user guide as an XHTML document, and
three LaTeX documents.  The CPSA Primer provides the background
required to make effective use of the CPSA tool collection.  For those
interested in the implementation, The CPSA Theory contains a
high-level description of the algorithm and the current state of the
effort to show that when program terminates, it produces a description
of every possible execution of the protocol consistent with the
initial point-of-view skeleton.  The CPSA Specification formally
describes the implemented algorithm as a term reduction system.  The
CPSA Design describes implementation details and assumes The CPSA
Specification has been read.  The CPSA Design should be read if one is
interested in reading the Haskell source for the tool collection.

TEST SUITE

: To run the test suite type:
$ ./cpsatst

Tests with the .scm extension are expected to complete without error,
tests with the .lsp extension are expected to fail, and tests with the
.lisp extension are not run.  New users should read tst/README, and
then browse the files it suggests while reading CPSA documentation.

Don't develop your protocols in the tst directory.  The Makefile is
optimized for testing the cpsa program, not analyzing protocols.

ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS

The src directory of the source distributions includes programs
written in Scheme, Prolog, and Elisp for performing tasks.  Use them
as templates for your special purpose CPSA analysis and transformation
needs.  Also, when given the --json option, the CPSA pretty printer
cpsapp will transform CPSA S-expressions into JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON).

On Linux, the GHC runtime can request so much memory that thrashing
results.  The script in src/ghcmemlimit sets an environment variable
that limits memory to the amount of free and reclaimable memory on
your machine.

KNOWN BUGS

Variable separation in generalization fails to separate variables in
terms of the form (ltk a a).
